                <a href="https://www.artstation.com/aliena85">Mandy Jurgens</a> is fascinated by how colour and texture can influence our emotions: “I aim to create a little magic through portraits of people both real and imagined," she says. 
                In her art, created in Photoshop and Procreate, Jurgens looks for the excuse to use some of her favourite colours and tones, including yellows and purples. She plays with the viewer's gaze, focusing on how materials reflect the sunlight in her paintings.

                <a href="https://www.behance.net/MKmiec">Małgorzata Kmiec</a> is a freelance artist based in Berlin, who specialises in stylised and colourful portraits. She believes anyone who thinks magic doesn’t exist has never heard of art, and aims to put a bit of magic into all her work.
                “I'm often inspired by seasons and nature, and this painting is a tribute to early spring,” she says of Spring Spirit (above). “I wanted to surround my character with warm colours that reflect the spirit of the season.”

                "I've had a passion for art since I was a child," says digital artist and illustrator <a href="https://www.storyartistrachelwalpole.com">Rachel Walpole</a>. "I whisk myself away to huge floating desert islands, angels with a questionable amount of wings, and creatures larger than countries."

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.behance.net/MKmiec">Jeszika Le Vye</a> describes herself as an “imaginative realist painter”, combining her loves of Classical Realism with a passion for sci-fi and fantasy. Her digital artwork explores themes of psychology and philosophy. “In my art, I explore what gives a thing its substance, its soul,” she explains.
                The above painting appeared to Le Vye almost fully realised in her mind, and she began working on it before planning a concept or narrative. “As I painted it, the piercing eyes of the boy kept bringing to mind Peter Pan,” she says. “I imagined this ageless child living away from reality in his own world, kept company by natural wonders and his own shadow.”
